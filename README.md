# Scrabble Mod 2 Fianl Assessment

Wrote a simple program in React, that lets a user type in a word to play in Scrabble and is returned its point value as they type.  The words are also stored in an array on submit for future refrence.  There is no database or local storage associated with program so the array of words are only saved until the browser or tab in browser are closed.
